# Hi, I'm Kelian 👋

I'm a future researcher in AI — driven by a vision far beyond applications.

## 🧠 What I work on

- 📌 **Current Project:**  
  `Contractive Dynamical Systems & Their Role in Stable Neural Modeling`  
  Exploring stability and convergence in dynamical systems — from simple functions to neural architectures.

- 🛠️ **Skills & Topics:**  
  Applied Mathematics · Deep Learning · Dynamical Systems · Theory-Driven AI · Interpretability

- 🧪 **Upcoming:**  
  Building a strong research portfolio during my studies — to one day contribute to high-impact fundamental research in AI.

## 🌍 Why I do this

I don't want to just use AI.  
I don't want to just apply what others created.  
I want to understand, build, and shape the very mechanisms  
that carry AI into a future we can trust.

> *I believe in responsible, interpretable AGI —  
designed not just for power,  
but for clarity, understanding, and long-term safety.*

Germany needs people who not only accelerate the technology  
but **anchor it in meaning.**  
That's who I strive to be.

## 🤍 And one day...

I hope this work becomes part of something even greater —  
a life of meaning, research, and deep love.  
For the one I'm already building this for.
